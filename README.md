# Cat vs Dog Classification

A simple image classification project to distinguish cats from dogs. This repository contains code, notebooks, and instructions to prepare the dataset, train a classifier, evaluate performance, and run inference on new images.

> NOTE: This README is intentionally framework-agnostic. Adapt commands to your chosen framework (PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, etc.) or the scripts present in your repository.

## Project overview
This project trains a binary image classifier to tell whether an image is of a cat or a dog. It demonstrates the typical workflow:
- download and prepare a labeled dataset
- build and train a convolutional neural network (or fine-tune a pretrained model)
- evaluate the model on held-out data
- run inference on new images

## Dataset
Common datasets to use:
- Kaggle Dogs vs. Cats: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats
- You may also use smaller or custom datasets; ensure images are labeled into `cats/` and `dogs/` directories.

The repository expects a layout like:
- data/
  - train/
    - cats/
    - dogs/
  - val/
    - cats/
    - dogs/
  - test/
    - cats/
    - dogs/

If you downloaded the original Kaggle competition, split the images into train/validation/test directories (e.g., 80/10/10 split).

## Repository structure
(Adjust to match this repo's actual files)
- README.md - this file
- requirements.txt - Python dependencies
- data/ - dataset (not tracked)
- notebooks/ - experiments and visualizations
- src/ or scripts/ - training, evaluation, inference scripts
- models/ - saved model checkpoints
- results/ - metrics, plots

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- A GPU is recommended for training (NVIDIA + CUDA)
- Typical Python packages:
  - numpy, pandas, matplotlib
  - Pillow or opencv-python
  - torch, torchvision (for PyTorch-based code) OR tensorflow, tensorflow.keras (for TF-based code)
  - scikit-learn
  - tqdm

Install via:
```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/srinivas-pullela/Cat_vs_Dog_Classification.git
cd Cat_vs_Dog_Classification
```
2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # macOS / Linux
venv\Scripts\activate           # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Preparing the data
1. Download the dataset (e.g., from Kaggle).
2. Unpack and organize into `data/train`, `data/val`, and `data/test` with `cats/` and `dogs/` subfolders.
3. Optionally apply preprocessing, augmentation, or normalization in your data loader.

Example script (pseudo):
```bash
python scripts/prepare_data.py --source ./raw_data --out ./data --val-split 0.1 --test-split 0.1
```

## Training
Typical command (replace with actual script names/flags in this repo):

```bash
python scripts/train.py \
  --data-dir ./data \
  --model resnet50 \
  --batch-size 32 \
  --epochs 20 \
  --lr 1e-4 \
  --output-dir ./models/exp1
```

Training tips:
- Start with a pretrained model (transfer learning) for faster convergence.
- Use data augmentation (flip, rotate, color jitter).
- Monitor validation loss and use early stopping or model checkpointing.

## Evaluation
After training, evaluate on the test set:

```bash
python scripts/evaluate.py --data-dir ./data/test --checkpoint ./models/exp1/best.pth --batch-size 32
```

Common metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision / Recall / F1-score
- Confusion matrix
- ROC curve / AUC

Save evaluation results and plots in `results/`.

## Inference / Prediction
Predict a single image:

```bash
python scripts/predict.py --image ./examples/cat1.jpg --checkpoint ./models/exp1/best.pth
# Output: class (cat/dog) and confidence score
```

Batch inference can be added to process a folder of images and output CSV with predictions.

## Results and expected performance
- With transfer learning on a balanced dataset, typical validation accuracy can exceed 90% depending on model capacity and augmentation.
- Overfitting is common on small datasetsâ€”use augmentation, weight decay, and dropout as needed.

Include sample plots and example results in `notebooks/` (training curves, confusion matrix, example predictions).

## Troubleshooting & tips
- If training is slow, reduce batch size or use a smaller model.
- If overfitting: increase augmentation, reduce learning rate, add regularization.
- If underfitting: increase model capacity, train longer, or use stronger augmentations.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome. Typical ways to help:
- Add training scripts for a specific framework
- Provide preprocessed dataset split scripts
- Add notebooks for EDA and results visualization
- Improve documentation and examples

If you want me to tailor this README to the exact scripts and framework in this repository (for example, add exact commands for `train.py`, `evaluate.py`, or provide example outputs), tell me:
- which framework your code uses (PyTorch/TensorFlow/other)
- which training/eval scripts are present and their CLI names
and I will update the README to match precisely.
